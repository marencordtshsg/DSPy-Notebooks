# DSPy-Notebooks
The task was to use DSPy in our backend of the Slide Evaluation Support System to ensure reproducibility and optimize the way we call the LLMs. This repository explores several Working Examples and tries out optimizers initially intended for other use cases on our own use case. The most valuable results are the pipelines and BootstrapFewShot.
