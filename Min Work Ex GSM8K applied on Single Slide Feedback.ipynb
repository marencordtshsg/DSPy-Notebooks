Slide title (T1) and slide messages (T2) help the audiences more easily understand the main content of the exposition. 6. Use the grid structure. A grid structure helps organize target and comparison items in rows and columns, creating a table-like format. 7. Itemize the text. Text itemization is good in terms of readability and organization. 8. Add a comment. Comments aid in audiences’ understanding. 9. Correct flow. Left-to-right top-to-bottom flow mimics human scanning methods. 10. MECE. Mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive (MECE) objects should be aligned without omissions and duplication to make the slides convincing. 11. Consistent formatting. Look for and point out inconsistencies.', 'answer': '**Slide Critique and Recommendations:**1. **Insert a Pictogram:**   - **Why:** The slide is text-heavy and lacks visual elements to make the content engaging and easier to understand. - **Where:** At the sections explaining concepts like ‘Generative AI’ or ‘ChatGPT’. - **How:** Use pictograms related to AI, machine learning, or chatbots. 2. **Add a Subheading:** - **Why:** Subheadings can break down the content into digestible sections. - **Where:** Subheadings can be added to sections like ‘Generative AI Platforms’, ‘Business Plan’, etc. - **How:** Use clear and descriptive subheadings such as ‘AI Applications’, ‘Business Strategy’, etc. 3. **Emphasize Words:** - **Why:** Important terms and key points are buried within dense paragraphs. - **Where:** Terms like ‘Generative AI’, ‘ChatGPT’, ‘prompt’, etc. - **How:** Use bold or italics to highlight these terms. 4. **Emphasize Areas:** - **Why:** Key areas need to stand out to capture attention quickly. - **Where:** In sections like ‘Stages of Development of Generative AI-Applications’ and ‘Benefits and Challenges of Using ChatGPT’. - **How:** Use colored boxes or borders around critical areas. 5. **Add T1 and T2:** - **Why:** The slide lacks a clear hierarchy, making it hard to follow. - **Where:** Title (T1) should be bold and larger, Slide messages (T2) should summarize key points. - **How:** Example - T1: ‘Generative AI Applications’, T2: ‘Various use cases showcasing the capabilities of generative AI’. 6. **Use the Grid Structure:** - **Why:** The slide lists several data points that would be clearer in a structured format. - **Where:** Sections like ‘Types of Generative AI and use cases’. - **How:** Create table-like grids for comparison and alignment. 7. **Itemize the Text:** - **Why:** Text blocks are unwieldy and hard to parse. - **Where:** Sections like ‘Business Plan’ and ‘Examples for the use of ChatGPT’. - **How:** Use bullet points to break down actions and steps. 8. **Add a comment:** - **Why:** Comments aid in audiences’ understanding.  - **Where:** Sections like ‘#\\\\n# Generative AI and ChatGPT’. - **How:** Add a comment in which you rephrase to help the audience understand quicker and easier. 9. **Correct Flow:** - **Why:** Content flow is currently disorganized and does not follow a logical progression. - **Where:** Rearrange sections so they logically follow each other (e.g., from basic definitions to practical applications). - **How:** Ensure the information follows a left-to-right or top-to-bottom flow. 10. **MECE:** - **Why:** The information needs to be more systematically categorized without overlaps or gaps. - **Where:** In all textual sections. - **How:**  Ensure each point falls under a distinct and necessary category, improving clarity and comprehension. 11. **Consistent Formatting:** - **Why:** Inconsistencies in font size, style, and indentation detract from professionalism. - **Where:** Across the entire slide, especially in headings and body texts. - **How:** Standardize font sizes and styles, and ensure uniform indentation. 12. **Citation Style:** - **Why:** Citations are scattered and not consistently formatted. - **Where:** At the end of sections or slides. - **How:** Use a consistent citation style like APA, and ensure uniform format for all references. Implementing these checkpoints will provide visual appeal, improve readability, and make the content easier to follow and understand.'}) (input_keys={'question'})]\n"]}],"source":["print(gsm8k_trainset)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Code our Chain-Of-Thought logic into a method using information from dspy.Module and equip it with the function to forward a question."],"metadata":{"id":"seH7mYJWX80U"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":1888,"status":"ok","timestamp":1720006364627,"user":{"displayName":"Maren C","userId":"09874795541244446052"},"user_tz":-120},"id":"cvT6EHiuBYC4","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"outputId":"88656f64-40e2-4096-9d0a-da6b60e3658b"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["100%|██████████| 7473/7473 [00:00<00:00, 25655.77it/s]\n","100%|██████████| 1319/1319 [00:00<00:00, 22616.30it/s]\n"]}],"source":["class CoT(dspy.Module):\n","    def __init__(self):\n","        super().__init__()\n","        self.prog = dspy.ChainOfThought(\"question -> answer\")\n","\n","    def forward(self, question):\n","        return self.prog(question=question)\n","\n","gsm8k = GSM8K()"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Set up our optimizer and apply it along our LLM-calling program to be optimized on a given gsm8k_metric.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"AIyl2DorYKn1"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":5482,"status":"ok","timestamp":1720006387300,"user":{"displayName":"Maren C","userId":"09874795541244446052"},"user_tz":-120},"id":"QSPPh5yMBcg6","outputId":"2503846d-aef0-4e14-fefc-5569e58aad2b"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["100%|██████████| 2/2 [00:05<00:00,  2.59s/it]"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Bootstrapped 0 full traces after 2 examples in round 0.\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["\n"]}],"source":["from dspy.teleprompt import BootstrapFewShot\n","from dspy.datasets.gsm8k import GSM8K, gsm8k_metric\n","import os\n","# Set up the optimizer: we want to \"bootstrap\" (i.e., self-generate) 4-shot examples of our CoT program.\n","config = dict(max_bootstrapped_demos=4, max_labeled_demos=4)\n","# Optimize!
