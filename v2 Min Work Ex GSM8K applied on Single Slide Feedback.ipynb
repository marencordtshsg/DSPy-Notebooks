Look for and point out inconsistencies.' , 'answer': '**Slide Critique and Recommendations:**1. **Insert a Pictogram:**   - **Why:** The slide is text-heavy and lacks visual elements to make the content engaging and easier to understand. - **Where:** At the sections explaining concepts like ‘Generative AI’ or ‘ChatGPT’. - **How:** Use pictograms related to AI, machine learning, or chatbots. 2. **Add a Subheading:** - **Why:** Subheadings can break down the content into digestible sections. - **Where:** Subheadings can be added to sections like ‘Generative AI Platforms’, ‘Business Plan’, etc. - **How:** Use clear and descriptive subheadings such as ‘AI Applications’, ‘Business Strategy’, etc. 3. **Emphasize Words:** - **Why:** Important terms and key points are buried within dense paragraphs. - **Where:** Terms like ‘Generative AI’, ‘ChatGPT’, ‘prompt’, etc. - **How:** Use bold or italics to highlight these terms. 4. **Emphasize Areas:** - **Why:** Key areas need to stand out to capture attention quickly. - **Where:** In sections like ‘Stages of Development of Generative AI-Applications’ and ‘Benefits and Challenges of Using ChatGPT’. - **How:** Use colored boxes or borders around critical areas. 5. **Add T1 and T2:** - **Why:** The slide lacks a clear hierarchy, making it hard to follow. - **Where:** Title (T1) should be bold and larger, Slide messages (T2) should summarize key points. - **How:** Example - T1: ‘Generative AI Applications’, T2: ‘Various use cases showcasing the capabilities of generative AI’. 6. **Use the Grid Structure:** - **Why:** The slide lists several data points that would be clearer in a structured format. - **Where:** Sections like ‘Types of Generative AI and use cases’. - **How:** Create table-like grids for comparison and alignment. 7. **Itemize the Text:** - **Why:** Text blocks are unwieldy and hard to parse. - **Where:** Sections like ‘Business Plan’ and ‘Examples for the use of ChatGPT’. - **How:** Use bullet points to break down actions and steps. 8. **Add a comment:** - **Why:** Comments aid in audiences’ understanding.  - **Where:** Sections like ‘#\\\\n# Generative AI and ChatGPT’. - **How:** Add a comment in which you rephrase to help the audience understand quicker and easier. 9. **Correct Flow:** - **Why:** Content flow is currently disorganized and does not follow a logical progression. - **Where:** Rearrange sections so they logically follow each other (e.g., from basic definitions to practical applications). - **How:** Ensure the information follows a left-to-right or top-to-bottom flow. 10. **MECE:** - **Why:** The information needs to be more systematically categorized without overlaps or gaps. - **Where:** In all textual sections. - **How:**  Ensure each point falls under a distinct and necessary category, improving clarity and comprehension. 11. **Consistent Formatting:** - **Why:** Inconsistencies in font size, style, and indentation detract from professionalism. - **Where:** Across the entire slide, especially in headings and body texts. - **How:** Standardize font sizes and styles, and ensure uniform indentation. 12. **Citation Style:** - **Why:** Citations are scattered and not consistently formatted. - **Where:** At the end of sections or slides. - **How:** Use a consistent citation style like APA, and ensure uniform format for all references. Implementing these checkpoints will provide visual appeal, improve readability, and make the content easier to follow and understand.'}).with_inputs('question'),\n","\n","    Example({'question': \"#\\\\n# Generative AI and ChatGPT: Beyond the Hype\\\\n\\\\n# Generative AI and ChatGPT: Beyond the Hype\\\\n\\\\n# Prof. Dr. Jan Marco Leimeister\\\\n\\\\nFrom insight to impact.\\\\n---\\\\nBy 2025, generative AI is expected to account for 10% of all data produced (up from less than 1% in 2021).\\\\n\\\\nBy 2025, 30% of outbound marketing messages from large organizations will be synthetically generated (up from less than 2% in 2022).\\\\n\\\\nBy 2030, a major blockbuster film will be released with 90% of the film generated by AI (from 0% of such in 2022).\\\\n\\\\nSources: Gartner (2021) and Gartner (2023)\\\\n---\\\\n#\\\\n# Presentation Slide Deck\\\\n\\\\n# Agenda\\\\n\\\\n1. # Introduction to Generative AI\\\\n\\\\n- Definition and Development of a Generative AI\\\\n- Types of Generative AI, Use Cases and Platforms\\\\n2. # Latest Application: ChatGPT\\\\n\\\\n- Introduction and Use Cases for ChatGPT\\\\n- Constructing Effective Prompts\\\\n- Benefits and Challenges of Using ChatGPT\\\\n3. # Let‘s get to work!\\\\n4. # Summary\\\\n\\\\nChatGPT: Beyond the Hype | Prof. Dr. Jan Marco Leimeister (IWI-HSG)\\\\n---\\\\n# Introduction Prof. Dr. Jan Marco Leimeister\\\\n\\\\n- Professor and Director at the Institute of Information Management of the University of St.Gallen.\\\\n- Director at the ‘Wissenschaftlichen Zentrum für IT Gestaltung’ of the University of Kassel in Germany.\\\\n- Main research areas: Digital Business, Digital Transformation, Digital Service Management, Crowdsourcing, Digital Work and Collaboration Engineering.\\\\n- Internationally awarded for outstanding activities in research, teaching, and education.\\\\n- Repeatedly ranked among the top 1% of the best Researchers and Professors in business informatics.\\\\n---\\\\n#\\\\n# Presentation\\\\n\\\\n# Learning Goals\\\\n\\\\n’Generative AI and ChatGPT: Beyond the Hype’\\\\n\\\\n- You can name the key elements of Generative AI.\\\\n- You understand the ChatGPT application and its use cases.\\\\n- You can apply effective prompts for ChatGPT.\\\\n\\\\n&copy; Prof. Dr. Jan Marco Leimeister – Institut für Wirtschaftsinformatik (IWI-HSG) St.Gallen 5\\\\n---\\\\n# Introduction to Generative AI\\\\n---\\\\n#\\\\n# Adoption Rate: Bandwagon Effect at Work\\\\n\\\\nAdoption Rate: Bandwagon Effect at Work\\\\n\\\\nSource: (https://twitter.com/kylelf_) (Feb 16, 2023)\\\\n\\\\n© Prof. Dr. Jan Marco Leimeister – Institut für Wirtschaftsinformatik (IWI-HSG) St.Gallen\\\\n---\\\\n#\\\\n# Generative AI Definition\\\\n\\\\n# Definition of a Generative AI\\\\n\\\\n’Generative AI (GenAI) is a class of machine learning (ML) algorithms that can learn from content such as text, images, and audio in order to generate new content.’\\\\n\\\\nData:\\\\n\\\\n- Text: Training Transformer\\\\n- Images: Model (Neural Network)\\\\n- Speech: Add & Normalize Embedding\\\\n- Structured Data: 3D Signals\\\\n\\\\nTasks:\\\\n\\\\n- Question Answering\\\\n- Sentiment Analysis\\\\n- Info Extraction\\\\n- Image Captioning\\\\n- Object Recognition\\\\n\\\\nSources: Vaswani et al.

Do NOT just repeat the checkpoint descriptions. Additionally, if a checkpoint is applicable describe WHY, WHERE and HOW in the slide the checkpoints should be implemented: 1. Insert a pictogram. Pictogram insertion can intuitively convey the slide content. 2. Add a subheading. Subheading addition makes the audiences convenient to find information. 3. Emphasize words. Emphasizing important words enhances a part of a text to make it noticeable. 4. Emphasize areas. Emphasizing important areas of the slides helps focus attention. 5. Add T1 and T2. Slide title (T1) and slide messages (T2) help the audiences more easily understand the main content of the exposition. 6. Use the grid structure. A grid structure helps organize target and comparison items in rows and columns, creating a table-like format. 7. Itemize the text.
